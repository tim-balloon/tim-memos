# tim-memos
Technical memos for the TIM project.

The idea is to create new directories, each corresponding to a different memo topic, explaining and documenting the design choices for various aspects of the project, as well as capturing key calculations which tend to be lost in personal lab notebooks or email chains.

Some memos may need to be captured at a particular time to create a historical record for choices, but the idea is to create a living documentation repository with a low barrier to entry and to maintaining and updating.
