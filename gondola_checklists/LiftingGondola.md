# Purpose

This standard operating procedure (SOP) is intended to provide guidance on how to safely lift the Terahertz Intensity Mapper (TIM) gondola during ground testing. Laboratory personnel should review this SOP, as well as the appropriate Safety Data Sheet(s) (SDSs), before lifting the TIM gondola. If you have questions concerning the requirements within this SOP, contact [Evan C. Mayer](evanmayer@arizona.edu) or [Ian Lowe](ianlowe@arizona.edu). This SOP is based on the [UArizona Laboratory Standard Operating Procedure Template](https://research.arizona.edu/compliance/RLSS/chemical-safety/forms-and-templates).

# Scope

This SOP applies during the process leading up to and during a lift operation where the TIM gondola leaves the ground. It applies to all participants from the science team.

# Hazard Description

* Crushing: gondola contact points (support feet) may present crushing hazard if gondola were to fall or tilt during lift or motion
* Blunt force impact: gondola structure may present impact hazard if gondola motion were to become uncontrolled

# Process & Hazard Controls

## Elimination/Substitution

* Do not perform a lift operation if the test does not require motion in azimuth
* Place TIM gondola on casters if operation does not require controlled azimuth motion

## Engineering Controls

* Guide line affixed to TIM gondola outer frame on a rigid structural member

## Work Practices

* Required personnel:
    * 1 trained crane operator
    * 1 guide line operator
    * 1 spotter for surroundings

## Personal Protective Equipment

* Hard hats
* Safety glasses
* High visibility vests
* Gloves
* Protective shoes

# Procedure

> **NOTE:** This procedure can only augment onsite safety procedures; where both this procedure and onsite safety procedures are in effect, the more stringent of the two apply.

## Lift Preparation

1. [ ] Check crane load capacity
    1. If TIM gondola exceeds crane load capacity, do not proceed with the lift
2. [ ] Clean up! **Remove debris from gondola and surrounding area**
    1. **No loose items on the gondola or inside rotational envelope**
3. [ ] Check lift points
    1.  All fasteners for lifting devices are properly tightened
4. [ ] Check suspension cables
    1. Clevis pins and cotter pins installed
    2. Turnbuckles locked down
5. [ ] Check gondola feet
    1. All feet are properly fastened to support members
6. [ ] Check manual controls
    1. At least one lead for guiding by hand
    2. Must be affixed to a stationary part of the gondola
7. [ ] Participant hard hats
8. [ ] Check any links between gondola and ground stations
    1. Provision for wrapping/strain relief of power and data cables
9. [ ] Check range of motion of axes:
    1. Elevation axis constrained, either by a lifting strap or a lock pin
    2. Azimuth axis constrained
        1. Guide line is attached to a person or stationary object
10. [ ] Check path to lift destination
    1. If TIM gondola will be relocated, check path between current position and final position, ensuring path is clear of obstacles and personnel

## Lift Operation

**Never lift the gondola alone.**

Required personnel:
* 1 trained crane operator
* 1 person guide line attached to gondola
* Spotter for lift

### Begin lift

1. [ ] Notify bystanders of lift: Talk to each one, "LIFT WARNING" or similar
    1. *You must be loud enough to notify bystanders who may not be paying attention to the lift*
2. [ ] Double check hard hats and shoes
3. [ ] Disengage crane safety mechanism
4. [ ] Begin lift slowly
5. [ ] Pay attention to gondola feet to determine which direction gondola will swing
    1. Re-evaluate guide lines if necessary
6. [ ] Once all feet are off ground, stop swinging motion using guide line(s)
7. [ ] Check gondola azimuth envelope
    1. Ideally, TIM can move 360deg freely
    2. Move TIM through available range of azimuth motion, rotating in both directions, watching and listening for smooth pivot motion
    3. Observe any cable wrap to stationary items on ground: Ethernet, power, etc.

## Set Down Operation

1. [ ] Ensure area beneath TIM gondola is free of obstacles and personnel
2. [ ] Set down gondola until first contact is made and stop
3. [ ] Allow TIM gondola to cease moving
4. [ ] Fully set down TIM gondola
5. [ ] Notify bystanders of all clear: "all clear"
6. [ ] Safe crane
