# Purpose

This standard operating procedure (SOP) is intended to provide guidance on how to align the motion axes of the Terahertz Intensity Mapper (TIM) gondola. Laboratory personnel should review this SOP, as well as the appropriate Safety Data Sheet(s) (SDSs), before assembling the TIM gondola. If you have questions concerning the requirements within this SOP, contact [Evan C. Mayer](evanmayer@arizona.edu) or [Alex Manduca](manduca@sas.upenn.edu). This SOP is based on the [UArizona Laboratory Standard Operating Procedure Template](https://research.arizona.edu/compliance/RLSS/chemical-safety/forms-and-templates).

# Scope

This SOP applies before shipping to Palestine, TX for integration testing, and may apply during assembly in Palestine or at McMurdo, if the gondola needs to be reassembled. It applies to all the team members assembling the gondola.

# Hazard Description

* Crushing/pinching: gondola structural members may present crushing hazard if they were to fall or tilt during assembly

# Process & Hazard Controls

* Use crane and appropriate satefy measures for lifting heavy components

## Elimination/Substitution

## Engineering Controls

## Work Practices

* Maintain work area cleanliness. Put away tools when not in use. Avoid leaving tools on the gondola structure.

## Personal Protective Equipment

* Hard hats
* Safety glasses
* High visibility vests
* Protective shoes

# Procedure

> **NOTE:** This procedure can only augment onsite safety procedures; where both this procedure and onsite safety procedures are in effect, the more stringent of the two apply.

## Background

The gondola motion axes shall be aligned to the maximum practical precision in order to minimize pointing errors.

Initial alignment of the elevation axis calls for an optical bench-quality surface to set the relative heights the motor assembly and support bearing assembly. This shall be done at Arizona or UPenn before assembly and the relevant shims and adjustments shall be maintained afterward by prohibiting disassembly.

## Alignment

1. On optical bench, adjust elevation starboard bearing to be level with elevation motor axis
	1. Square the face of the elevation motor flange to the table: right-angle plate
	2. This can be done with an alignment tube, or with the bearings pressed directly face-to-face.
	3. This sets the height of the far side of the elevation axis, on rollers, relative to its shimmed assembly base plate
	4. The elevation axis far side bearing shall be shimmed as it will be on the gondola
2. Make tops of A-frame co-planar, relative only to each other. This replicates the situation of the optical bench for which the motor and bearing were shimmed to be square and concentric
	1. This requires photogrammetry, or perhaps the True Level
3. Make reaction wheel base plate plane parallel to tops of A-frame
	1. Transfer the difference between the surface normal(s) and the local gravity vector from the top plates to the reaction wheel base plate
	2. It doesn't matter if the floor is level or flat or not, since the gravity vector provides a consistent reference vector.
	3. Reaction wheel hub was leveled relative to the base plate in Fort Sumner 2024
4. Mount the elevation axis motor
5. Trim the motor flange to be parallel to the best fit plane bisecting the elevation axis A-frame planes that face each other
	1. This constructs the outer frame azimuth vector
6. Adjust the elevation motor fore-aft and port-starboard positions to be roughly consistent with CAD, to help place the CG of the inner frame as close to design as possible, and to ensure the inner frame is roughly centered between the A-frames
7. Mount the elevation axis support bearing on its shimmed assembly base plate
8. Install the elevation axis alignment tube to transfer the motor axis of rotation to the far side of the gondola
	1. Mate with the elevation axis motor flange, and ensure concentricity with it with dial indicator
	2. Mate with the elevation axis support bearing, and ensure concentricity with dial indicator
	3. Adjust the port-starboard spacing of the elevation axis support bearing assembly to have correct available throw with the black steel rollers
	4. Adjust the fore-aft location of the elevation axis support bearing assembly to the extent possible, minimizing the cant angle of the spherical bearing

At this point, the elevation axis and reaction wheel axis are perpendicular, and the elevation axis steering angle relative to the outer frame is minimized. When the gondola is suspended and balanced using counterweights and turnbuckle adjustment, the reaction wheel axis of rotation with be parallel to the gravity vector, and the elevation axis will be parallel to the horizon.

> NOTE: Adjusting the suspension cable turnbuckles can allow the reaction wheel axis of rotation to be aligned with the gravity vector for any arbitrary mass distribution. However, a mass imbalance port-starboard or fore-aft in the outer frame will cause the reaction wheel axis to fail to pass through the pivot point above the pivot motor after turnbuckle leveling. The gravity and reaction wheel vectors can be made parallel, but the reaction wheel axis of rotation would be offset from the gravity vector pointing from the pivot to the Earth.
