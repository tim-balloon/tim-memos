Refer to `./files/TIM SUSPENSION CABLES REV A SEPT26-2022.pdf` for details; we actually are going to use 19 mm diameter instead of the quoted 18 mm (for better values of breaking strength) and different turnbuckles (due to availability). \n",

So, the minimum breakng load (MBL) is 22.7 US Tons, which is higher than their corresponding 13 mm diameter cables. So, the limiting factor here has to be the cables.
